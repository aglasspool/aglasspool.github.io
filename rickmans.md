The maternal side of the family is also picked up in the 1841 census (the first census to list the names of every individual person).

It picks up Big Ears' great-great grandfather Jonah Rickman as well as his father and elder brother as inmates aboard [HMS Stirling Castle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMS_Stirling_Castle_(1811)), Britain's last remaining ['prison hulk'](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_British_prison_hulks) moored permanently in Portsmouth Harbour:

*Prison Hulks in portsmouth harbour (1881)*

Young Jonah Rickman (age 16) and his brother James Rickman (JNR - 18yrs) as well as their father James Rickman (SNR - age 45) have been imprisoned on the ship for over a year.

The brothers had been convicted the previous year at Winchester Crown Court of stealing a sheep and their father convicted of receiving said stolen sheep (crime committed to the court by Lymington's Mayor James Munro (resident at Grosvenor House on the High St)):

*Court records from Winchester Crown Court 1840*

A newspaper archive from the time gives a description of the proceedings:

*Extract from local newspaper - 1840*

Further court records show that the brothers were sentenced to 10 years and the father to 14 years of 'transportation' - i.e. they would be transported to a penal colony (most probably Australia) to serve 10 and 14 years respectively of forced labour there.

*Court records from 14 July 1840 recording the sentencing of the Rickmans*

Four years later in 1845, they were still on the prison hulks in Portsmouth harbour. Apparently prisoners would be held for years before being 'transported' and served as slave labour in the dockyard for tasks like dredging, construction, and dockyard maintenance etc.. 

Prison records from 1845 show that James Rickman senior has at some point been transferred to a different hulk in the harbour (the York - probably being used as a prison hulk for the infirm at the time) and has died. The records describe him as an 'indifferent character' and that he has suffered a number of cuts to the face, arm, hands and fingers as well as a broken collar bone.

*Prison hulk records*

Other, more detailed prison records from the time, show that James Snr was transferred to the York in October 1844 with a broken collar bone as well as a number of other *illegible* injuries. James Senior as well as both sons are recorded as having a cut to their first fingers and many other prisoners are recorded as having cust to their first fingers.. Why cuts to the first fingers?? what forced kind of forced labour were they doing? or what other prisoner-related ritual could have inflicted this?

In these records they were also recorded as having been discharged in September 1845, several months after their father had died on the prisoner hulk York: 

![tna_ccc_pcom2_134_00025](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6925c2fc-5213-4cf8-8046-6f57d71a984d)
*Prison hulk records*

What became of James Rickman junior after his discharge is unknown. There is no record of him in any censuses or other records thereafter.

Our great grandad Jonah was picked up again in 1846 getting married and then again in the 1851 census living in Mill Street, Lymington. 

Then in the 1861 and 1871 censuses he is listed as Innkeeper at the Railway Inn on Quay Street:

![HAMRG10_1171_1173-0439](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1c37a138-d5fa-428a-a3f4-4da8d575ee24)
*1861?71? census*

The census shows that by now he had half a dozen children, all living at the inn. One of those (Harry Charles Rickman [born 1854]) went on to be Big Ears' grandfather. In early censuses he is recorded as a 'nightwatchman' but later turned builder and built houses around the turn of the century on Ambleside Road.

Here's the Railway Inn today:

## The Rickman roots

Lets work backwards now and see how far back we can go.

Lets start with Jonah's dad James from the prison hulk in 1841. 

James Rickman was born on 7 August 1796 and records show that he was a thatcher and that his father was called William (also a thatcher) and his mother called Mary (maiden name Murrey) and that they were married in 1779 (both from Milford-on-Sea).
