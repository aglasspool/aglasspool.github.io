The maternal side of the family is also picked up in the 1841 census (the first to list the names of every individual).

It picks up great-great-great grandfather Jonah Rickman as well as his father and elder brother as inmates aboard [HMS Stirling Castle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMS_Stirling_Castle_(1811)), Britain's last remaining ['prison hulk'](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_British_prison_hulks) moored permanently in Portsmouth Harbour:

*Prison Hulks in portsmouth harbour (1881)*

Young Jonah Rickman (age 16) and his brother James Rickman (JNR - 18yrs) as well as their father James Rickman (SNR - age 45) have been imprisoned on the ship for over a year.

The pair had been convicted the previous year at Winchester Crown Court of stealing a sheep and their father convicted of receiving said stolen sheep (crime committed to the court by Lymington's Mayor James Munro (resident at Grosvenor House no the High St)):

A newspaper archive from the time gives a description of the proceedings:

*Extract from local newspaper - 1840*

Further court records show that the brothers were sentenced to 10 years and the father 14 years of 'transportation' - i.e. they would be transported to a penal colony (probably Australia) to serve 10 and 14 years respectively of forced labour there.

*Court records from 14 July 1840 recording the sentencing of the Rickmans*

In 1845, prison records show that James Rickman senior has at some point been transferred to a different hulk in the harbour (the York) and has died. The records describe him as an 'indifferent character' and that he has suffered a number of cuts to the face, arm and hands as well as a broken collar bone.

*Prison hulk records*

Other prison records show that James Snr was transferred to the York in October 1844 with a broken collar bone as well as a number of other *illegible* injuries. Both sons are recorded as having a cut to their first fingers and also recorded as having been discharged in September 1845 after their father had died on the York:

*Prison hulk records*

What became of James junior is unknown. Great-great grandad Jonah was picked up again in 1846 getting married and then again in the 1851 census living in Mill Street, Lymington. 

Then in the 1861 and 1871 censuses Jonah is listed as Innkeeper at the Railway Inn on Quay Street:

*1861?71? census*

The census shows that he by now had half a dozen children, all living at the inn. One of those (Harry Charles Rickman [born 1854]) went on to be Jan's great grandfather. In early censuses he is recorded as a 'nightwatchman' but later turned builder and built houses around the turn of the century on Ambleside Road.

Here's the Railway Inn today:

## The Rickman roots

Lets work backwards now and see how far back we can go.

Lets start with Jonah's dad James from the prison hulk in 1841. 

James Rickman was born on 7 August 1796 and records show that he was a thatcher and that his father was called William (also a thatcher) and his mother called Mary (maiden name Murrey) and that they were married in 1779 (both from Milford-on-Sea).
