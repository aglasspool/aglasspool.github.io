# Charles Glasspool (GGGG)
This is where it all begins! Kennington Lane, just south of the Elephant & Castle near the end of the A3; what was then called Portsmouth Road because it was the old Roman road between London and Portsmouth. 

Charles Glasspool, age 45 is recorded in the 1841 Census as living at *41 Lower Kennington Lane* (also known as East House) near the King's Arms pub in Kennington.

*Photo of 41 Lower Kennington Lane - since renumbered first as 89 and now as no. 90 Kennington Lane.*

Here is a view of the rear of the building; it is clear from the brickwork and anchor plates, that the front part of the building has been added on to the older rear part:

![IMG_20250828_133050834_HDR](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/69919cab-e2e1-4608-81f1-2d7cf3408328)

Kennington Manor House (pictured below) is situated North of the building in question and is described by Lambeth Archives [here](https://boroughphotos.org/lambeth/manor-house-kennington-kennington-road-kennington/) as having stables next to it known as 'the long barn'. It says that they were both demolished in 1875 but it appears that the 'long barn' was actually only partly demolished at the front, leaving the long barn section of the stables still standing today.

*Kennington Manor House shortly before its demolition in 1875*

Here is the King's Arms pub, Long Barn and Manor House shown on a 1828 map of the area. The Long Barn has a 'T' at the front:

*1928 Greenwood Map of London*

An 1867 Council renumbering plan shows the Long Barn to be numbered as no. 86 but fails to show the old number (41). This could be due to the confusion from it also being known as 'East House'. 

![IMG_20250828_110513684](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/922a1f34-bd1e-4cee-9ded-a3a03bb61e9e)
*1867 renumbering plan showing the Long Barn to be numbered as no. 86 but failing to show the old number (41)* 

A later 1934 renumbering plan changes it from 86 to the current address which is no. 90 Kennington Lane after the pub has been redeveloped and the three shops between the pub and East House have been demolished:

## The census data
The 1841 census first picks up Charles living at no. 41 together with his then-to-be wife Mary Ann Welling (20 years his younger) and three other families:

![SRYHO107_1058_1058-0512(3)](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8bed7e32-b8f4-43a8-9f29-8bb9bb11bdf8)
*1841 Census*

They are then picked up again in the 1851 census at the same address but now married with one daughter (Matilda 11) and three sons (Charles 9, William 4 and Henry 2) as well as 3 other households:

![SRYHO107_1572_1572-1549](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/31fe2667-5c4a-435a-8ad4-7dd4e814d4d5)
*1851 Census*

The Census again listed Charles' profession as Cooper so is it possible that he worked at the King's Arms pub and that the lodgings came along with the job?
or did he work for one of the several breweries up the road?

Charles died three years after this census in 1854. 

The next census in 1861 shows Mary Ann Glasspool and the children now living at 42A Lower Kennington road. This census doesn't list number 41 so have they moved house or did the census just list what was 41 now as 42? This theory is backed up by the fact that previous censuses have shown three households living at number 41 and this census shows three households at number 42 (nos. 42, 42A and 42B).

![SRYRG9_352_355-0444(4)](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4b23e074-1f68-4fac-819e-542320cbfd3d)
*1861 Census Page 1*

![SRYRG9_352_355-0445(2)](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8236a73a-c608-4ebc-a8ab-33decff10a35)
*1861 Census Page 2*

There's the shoemaker Henry Brown at number 42, Mary Ann and children at 42A and Hotel porter Thomas Wilkinson at 42B. Matilda Glasspool, the eldest daughter (now 20) is also listed as a dressmaker so probably working for the family business. In between numbers 42 and 42A, 42B is 'East House' where auctioneer Raphael Myers and his wife live with their two grandaughters.

Have they now moved from 41 (East house) into the workshop next door to the right? This image shows the entrance to Viet Charles Mitchell's paint-making workshop at number 40 LKR at around circa 1850 and Mary Glasspool Dressmakers is listed in the post office directory (1960) as being next door on the left - or has the historic confusion around numbering just led to the three households recorded at number 41 now being misnumbered as 42, 42A and 42B? 

![42LKL](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1697054b-3cdd-4648-8609-6d22252771c0)
*Illustration showing Manor House in the background with Viet Charles Mitchell's paint workshop at 40 LKR*

The Post Office Directory from 1860 also shows that Mitchell shares that yard with William Sheppard (a 'Hatter') and that number 41 (listed as East House) is occupied by Richard Myers, an auctioneer. This is further confirmation that number 41 was indeed East House. At number 42, Mary Ann Glasspool is listed as Dressmaker:

![1860 Post office directory](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4334abad-788c-434c-8d29-3f6faf8c23ff)
*1860 Post Office Directory - Extract for Lower Kennington Lane*

The question is whether 42A is where Mary Ann and family are living at this point in time or whether this is where she has her dressmaking workshop, which might now be part of or attached to East House (number 41) - or whether they have always been at number 41 and this is just a mess up by the census enumerator?

The answer may lie in the 1871 Census which now shows East House (no.41) now renumber as no. 86 and that whilst there in no no. 85, next door there is a no. 85A which is described by the Census as 'this 85A is down a yard'. This is supported by the above-shown 1867 renumbering map, which shows an alleyway between numbers 86-84 and also the 1850 illustration showing Viet Charles Mitchell's paint yard at number 40 as being an entrance to a yard:

Here's a photo of the opposite side of the road showing St Mary's Chapel near the junction with Pleasant Row to give a flavour of how things would have looked back then:

## The move to Newington Butts
Mary Ann is next found on record in 1863 remarrying to a certain Joseph Knights (bachelor). They are all then picked up in the 1871 census living at number 74A Newington Butts. Here's a photo of Newington Butts looking south with the junction with St Gabriel Street on the right circa 1890; 74A would have been around 10 doors further down after St Gabriel Street on the right hand side.

![IMG_20250828_130053192_HDR](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d30e6e2f-63b8-4741-9ab5-df880dfcabf4)
*Newington Butts corner with St Gabriel Street circa 1890*

Here's the same part of Newington Butts but from the south side of St Gabriel Street on the left looking North circa 1930:

*Roughly number 70 Newington Butts on the left looking north through Elephant and Castle with St Gabriel St on the left (1930)*

This 1879 map shows that 42A would have been located directly adjacent to St Mary's Church:

Incidentally all Censuses lists Charles' four children as all having been born in there in Newington and their birth certificates confirm the address as 41 Lower Kennington Road. It also lists Charles' place of birth as Portsmouth (in 1797) and his wife's as Beeding; a village near Worthing. According to other records, Charles was born in Southwick near Portsmouth and his father was also born there. Their forefathers are all then listed as living in Titchfield near Portsmouth as far back as the beginning of the 15th Century. 

# William Glasspool I (GGG)
Charles' second son William was born at 41 LKR (according to his baptism certifcate from St Mary's Church) in 1847 and died in 1902 in Edmonton, London.
William married Elizabeth Mary Oliver who was born the same year in St John's Wood (North London). She died in 1917 in Bristol. Her elder/younger? brothers were born in Peckham in the early 1850s, which suggests that her family lived locally at the time they met.

After moving out of the family home in Newington Butts, William is picked up in the 1881 census at no. 6 Brunswick Place (part of the now-demolished Trinity Square estate):

![LNDRG11_534_537-0366(2)](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/88827c78-43f6-4306-a310-40126a555004)
*1881 Census*

Here's a map showing where it was:

![BrunswickPlace](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/674da59d-c461-4a90-95a2-ab7e31cb2823)
*Map showing Brunswick Place*

Here's an illustration showing how it would have looked at the time (Brunswick Place on the left looking south) the six-storey council blocks seen in the background (now the Rockingham estate off Harper Road) are still standing today:

![BrunswickPlaceillustration](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/123c6dc3-cec4-40fb-bd54-e0d3d1346f20)
*Illustration showing Brunswick Place on the left*

The census shows him as now married to a certain Elizabeth Glasspool and with children (Elizabeth (6), William (4) and George, (6 months). The eldest and youngest are both recorded as being born in Newington. William however, is recorded as being born in 'Llangyfelach' near Swansea in Wales. There is no explanation for this anomaly. Were they on holiday or visiting relatives when he was born?

In around 1890 the family moved to Tottenham and the 1901 census show that the whole family has moved to 16 Avondale road in Haringay near Turnpike Lane and have had two further children (Matilda 17 and Ernest 12). The census shows that the elder two siblings Elizabeth (26) and William II (24) had by this time moved out. The house at 16 Avondale road still stands. William I dies the following year. 

The next census in 1911 shows his wife Elizabeth Glasspool (now 64) living with her eldest daughter (also called Elizabeth) at 16 Winsor Terrace in Bristol. The census shows that one of the other family members is a lithographic printer.

# William Glasspool II (GG)
Not much is known about William the second's early life since he left the Southwark family home circa 1890 in his early twenties. All we know is that he must have moved to Bristol some time before 1909 when he married Edith Haines in Bristol.

He died at 8 Bonneville Gardens in Clapham on 18th Jan 1941. Both he and Edith were listed in the 1939 census as living at 8 Bonneville Gardens along with their son Edgar Glasspool and William's younger brother Ernest Glasspool (and other family members who have been redacted).

*1939 census*

The house in Clapham still exists today. Here it is:

In 1909 William II Married Edith Haines, daughter of Charles Haines, born 1849 in Clifton, Bristol. According to [this website](http://cliftonrfchistory.co.uk/members/membersH.htm) Charles' father William ran a Bakery. In one census, Charles' profession is listed as Printer/Compositor but in another he is recorded as a Musician so this is probably where the later musical impetus comes from (via Edith).

This (1929) Census has William George down as a Lithographer for a local Bristol printing firm Mardon Son & Hall. Is this the same company where his father-in-law worked? It was [known](https://www.wopc.co.uk/uk/mardon/) for printing collectable token cards for cigarette packets and was taken over by Imperial Tobacco in 1906.

# Allan Glasspool (G)
Was born in Bristol in 1913. In 1939 he married Elizabeth Barker whose family was from Stoke-on-Trent. This was her second marriage as her previous husband (Edward Lucas) had died at the age of 22. Edward's mother Elsie Jones was from north Wales.

In 1939, Allan is found in the Worthing local press on 14th October 1938, reported to have left Herbert Lodge's Symphony/Municipal Orchestra for the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra in London:

![IMG_20250824_173843005~2](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/04018705-7d21-47c9-a2e5-925f6bfa181c)
*Worthing local press 1939*

Records from the Royal Philharmonic Society show that he played for the London Symphony Orchestra and London Philharmonic Orchestra in spring 1939, including both at the Royal Opera House and the Queen's Hall (destroyed by a bomb in 1941).

He is then absent from records until reappearing again in 1948. It has been suggested that he was conscripted or joined the war effort in the Navy. Word has it that he survived two ship sinkings..
Naval records from those times difficult to access without death certificates etc.

His reappearance in 1948 was being listed as playing for the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra from Nov 17th 1948 to Dec 14th 1949 (seasons 137-138). All at the Royal Albert Hall and all under Sir Thomas Beecham.

![beecham](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bcbd8ffd-73b0-4391-9478-79c028107982)

There is no (easily available) record of him playing for the RPO after this.

Word has it that the RPO didn't pay well so he instead played film music which paid better. Suggestions have been made that he played for Vaughan Williams and Malcolm sergeant. Apparently these included the music for: Tarzan, Ben Hurr, The Sound of Music, Chitty Chitty Bang Bang and Bridge over the River Kwai. It has also been said that he played regularly at the annual [Glyndebourne Opera Festival](https://www.glyndebourne.com/) which is between Worthing and Eastbourne.

He is also said to have been a fan of jazz and played the saxophone. 

Allan and Liz are picked up again by a 1961 electoral register as living on the Henry Prince estate in Earlsfield, Wandsworth (number 188). This is the same estate where London Mayor Sadiq Khan grew up!
