# Charles Glasspool (GGG)
This is where it all began! The earliest Glasspool on record!
Charles Glasspool, aged 54 is picked up in the 1851 Census living at 39 Lower Kennington Lane in Kennington, London.

This is near the Elephant & Castle at the end of the A3, which used to be known as Portsmouth Road.

Number 39 Lower Kennington Lane is pictured here to the left of the derelict Lamb and Hare brewery in 1950:

The Census not clear as to whether Charles and his family actually lived at number 39, which is listed as a *Bash House*? What is a Bash House?

The Census lists Charles' address simply as LKL (Lower Kennington Lane), so could it be that they lived in the Lamb and Hare pub next door or were there lodgings through the alleyway shown above?

In any case, the Census listed his profession as Cooper so it is likely that he worked at the Lamb and Hare and lodgings were included in the job.

The Census lists his four children as all having been born in Lambeth, the eldest of which was 11 at the time of the Census. It also lists his place of birth as Portsmouth (in 1797) and his wife's as Beeding; a village near Brighton.

# William Glasspool (GG)
Charles' second son William was aged 4 at the time of the Census so born (most likely in Lower Kennington Road) in 1847 and died in 1902 in Edmonton, London.
