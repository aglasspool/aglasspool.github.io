# Charles Glasspool (GGGG)
This is where it all began! The earliest Glasspool on record!

Charles Glasspool, aged 45 is recorded in the 1841 Census as living at _41 Lower Kennington Lane_ behind the _Lamb and Hare_ brewery in Kennington.
He is listed as living there with his then-to-be wife Mary Welling and two other families living in the lodgings behind the brewery.

This is located near the Elephant & Castle at the end of the A3, which used to be known as Portsmouth Road because it was the main road between London and Portsmouth. The Barclay Perkins brewery (previously the Anchor brewery subsequently purchased by Barclays Bank) was [apparently](https://beerandbrewing.com/dictionary/pZTMpBv4Va/) the largest brewer in the world at that time 

Here is a photo from 1906 looking north towards Elephant & Castle, with the brewery pictured on the right:

The brewery along with most of the buildings next to it have since been demolished. The police station on the left has been demolished and replaced but the buildings housing the Butterfield Jewellery are still standing. Here is the same view today:

Another photo from Lambeth Council archives shows the derelict Lamb and Hare pub in 1950:

They are then picked up in the 1851 census at the same address but now married with one daughter (Matilda 11) and three sons (Charles 9, William 4 and Henry 2)

The Census again listed Charles' profession as Cooper so it is likely that he worked at the Lamb and Hare and that lodgings came along with the job.

The Census lists his four children as all having been born in there in Lambeth, the children's birth certificates confirm the address as 41 Lower Kennington Road. It also lists his place of birth as Portsmouth (in 1797) and his wife's as Beeding; a village near Worthing.

Charles died three years later in 1854. 

The next census in 1861

# William Glasspool (GGG)
Charles' second son William was aged 4 at the time of the Census so born (most likely in Lower Kennington Road) in 1847 and died in 1902 in Edmonton, London.
William married Elizabeth Mary Oliver who was born the same year in St John's Wood (North London). She died in 1917 in Bristol. Her elder brothers were born in Peckham in the early 1850s, which suggests that her family lived locally at the time they met.

Why did she die in Bristol 15 years after her husband's death in London?

# William George Glasspool (GG)
Listed in the xx census as being born in Swansea in 1876. This is an anomaly; all 5 of his siblings 1874 - 1888 were born in Newington (the area encompassing Lower Kennington Road) and he died at 8 Bonneville Gardens in Clapham on 18th Jan 1941. Both he and Edith were listed in the 1939 census as living at 8 Bonneville Gardens along with their son Edgar Glasspool and Williams brother? Ernest Glasspool.

The house still exists today. Here it is:

In 1909 he Married Edith Haines, daughter of Charles Haines, born 1849 Clifton, Bristol. According to [this website](http://cliftonrfchistory.co.uk/members/membersH.htm) Charles' father William ran a Bakery. In one census, Charles' profession is listed as Printer/Compositor but in another he is recorded as beieng a Musician so this is probably where the Glasspool family musical impetus comes from.

This (19??) Census has William George down as a Lithographer for a local Bristol printing firm Mardon Son & Hall. Is this the same company where his father-in-law worked? It was [known](https://www.wopc.co.uk/uk/mardon/) for printing collectable token cards for cigarette packets and was taken over by Imperial Tobacco in 1906.

# Allan Glasspool (G)
Was born in Bristol in 1913. In 1939 he married Elizabeth Barker whose family was from Stoke-on-Trent. This was her second marriage as her previous husband (Edward Lucas) had died at the age of 22. His mother Elsie Jones was from north Wales.

In 1939, Allan is found in the Worthing local press on 14th October 1938, reported to left Herbert Lodge's Symphony/Municipal Orchestra for the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra in London.

![IMG_20250824_173843005~2](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/04018705-7d21-47c9-a2e5-925f6bfa181c)

Records from the Royal Philharmonic Society show that he played for the London Symphony Orchestra and London Philharmonic Orchestra in spring 1939, including both at the Royal Opera House and the Queen's Hall (destroyed by a bomb in 1941).

He is then absent from records until reappearing again in 1948. It has been suggested that he was conscripted or joined the war effort in the Navy. Word has it that he survived two ship sinkings..
Naval records from those times are still difficult to access without death certificates etc.

His reappearance in 1948 was being listed as playing for the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra from Nov 17th 1948 to Dec 14th 1949 (seasons 137-138). All at the Royal Albert Hall and all under Sir Thomas Beecham.

There is no (easily available) record of him playing for the RPO after this.

Word has it that the RPO didn't pay well so he instead played film music which paid better. Suggestions have been made that he played for Vaughan Williams and Malcolm sergeant. Apparently these included the music for:Â Tarzan, Ben Hurr, The Sound of Music, Chitty Chitty Bang Bang and Bridge over the River Kwai. It has also been said that he played regularly at the annual [Glyndebourne Opera Festival](https://www.glyndebourne.com/) which is between Worthing and Eastbourne.

He is also said to have been a fan of jazz and played the saxophone. 

Allan and Liz are picked up again by a 1961? electoral register as living on the Henry Prince estate in Earlsfield, Wandsworth (number 188). This is the same estate where London Mayor Sadiq Khan grew up!
